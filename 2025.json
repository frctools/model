Pay close attention to their contents as they’re intended to provide insight into the reasoning behind a rule, helpful information on understanding or interpreting a rule, and/or possible “best practices” for use when implementing systems affected by a rule.\n\nWhile blue boxes are part of the manual, they do not carry the weight of the actual rule (if there is an inadvertent conflict between a rule and its blue box, the rule supersedes the language in the blue box).\n\nImperial dimensions are followed by comparable metric dimensions in parentheses to provide metric users with the approximate size, mass, etc. Metric conversions for non-rules (e.g. dimensions) round to the nearest whole unit, e.g. \"17 in. (~43 cm)” and “6 ft. 4 in. (~193 cm).” Metric conversions in rules round such that the metric dimension is compliant with the rule (i.e. maximums round down, minimums round up). The metric conversions are offered for convenient reference only and do not overrule or take the place of the imperial dimensions presented in this manual and the official drawings (i.e. dimensions and rules will always defer to measurements using imperial units).\n\nRules include colloquial language, also called headlines, in an effort to convey an abbreviated version of the rule or rule set. There are two versions of headline formatting. Evergreen rules, or rules which are expected to go relatively unchanged from season to season, are indicated with a leading asterisk and their rule number and headline are presented in bold green text. “Relatively unchanged” means that the overall intent and presence of the rule from season to season is constant, but game specific terms may be updated as needed (e.g.  changing Power Cells to ALGAE in a rule about what COACHES may not contact during a MATCH). These rules also start their respective section, so their rule number is not expected to change from season to season. All other rule headlines use bold blue text. Any disagreement between the specific language used in the rules and the colloquial language is an error, and the specific rule language is the ultimate authority. If you discover a disparity, please let us know at [customerservice@firstinspires.org](mailto:customerservice@firstinspires.org) and we will correct it.\n\nTeam resources that aren’t generally season specific (e.g., what to expect at an event, communication resources, team organization recommendations, ROBOT transportation procedures, and award descriptions) can be found on the [_FIRST_ Robotics Competition website](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).",

The BARGE has three CAGE locations on each side located 3 ft. 5½ in., 7 ft. ⅜ in., 10 ft. 7⅜ in. (~105 cm, ~214 cm, ~324 cm) from mid field to the center of the CAGE.\n\nThe BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and completion of the _Coopertition_ Bonus and the final 20 seconds in the match. One segment will light up each time an ALGAE is scored in the PROCESSOR. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE all six segments will illuminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. At the end of the match, the lights will illuminate and then turn off 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP to help indicate to REFEREES when scoring assessments should be made.\n\n### 5.4.1       CAGE\n\nFigure 5‑10 Shallow (left) and Deep (right) staged CAGES\n\n![Figure showing shallow and deep CAGES.](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image018.png)\n\nCAGES are 2 ft. tall and 7⅜ in. wide (outside dimension) (~61 cm tall and ~19 cm wide) rectangular structures.

It consists of 3 DRIVER STATIONS.\n\n### 5.6.1       DRIVER STATIONS\n\nFigure 5‑15 DRIVER STATION (ALLIANCE AREA perspective and FIELD perspective)\n\n![Figure showing DRIVER STATION and measurements.](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image023.png)\n\nA DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3 assemblies within an ALLIANCE WALL behind which a DRIVE TEAM operates their ROBOT. Each DRIVER STATION is made from a 3 ft. ¾ in. (~93 cm) tall diamond plate base topped with a 3 ft. 6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top rail. An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER STATION to support an OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. ¼ in. (~31 cm) deep. There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hook-and-loop tape (“loop” side) along the center of the support shelf that may be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf. The shelf also includes two clips to hold the shelf in place with a 1 in. (~25 mm) by 2 in. (~51 mm) thick tab that sits on the top surface of the shelf.\n\nThere may be a ramp available at events for DRIVE TEAMS with limited mobility. It is designed to allow an individual using a wheelchair to access the DRIVER STATION shelf and/or see onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has a wheelchair or other physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space constraints, the ramp is not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA.

There are 4 CORAL STATIONS, 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL STATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall (~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall) opening through which CORAL passes to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1½ in. (~95 cm) from the carpet. A 55° sloped tunnel, called the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION.\n\nThere are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 1 ft. 11 in. (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1½ in. (~34 cm) deep, 6¼ in. (~16 cm) tall, and rated for 300 lbs. (~136 kg).\n\nIt is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space constraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA.\n\nOnly 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest need. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to request that it is available for each of the team’s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their own ([Item Number: 779ac01stpm](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ozark-river-manufacturing-lil-step-booster-6-1-4-maple-wood-childrens-non-slip-step-stool/779AC01STPM.html)) or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and similar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use for every match.\n\nThis stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and equivalents are available at international events.

			"markdownContent": "5.7        SCORING ELEMENTS\n---------------------------\n\nSCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score additional points. There are 2 types of SCORING ELEMENTS used in REEFSCAPE: CORAL and ALGAE.\n\n### 5.7.1       CORAL\n\nFigure 5‑19 CORAL\n\n![Figure showing CORAL. ](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image028.png)\n\nA CORAL is a 11 ⅞ in. long (~30 cm) piece of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe. CORAL has a 4-in. (~102 mm) inside diameter and a 4½-in. (~11 cm) outside diameter. CORAL is available for purchase from AndyMark, [am-5601](https://www.andymark.com/RS25GP1) or can be cut from longer lengths of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe.\n\nPrior to Kickoff, CORAL was known as “Game Piece 1” and not available for pre-order prior to the season.\n\nCORAL in the KOP and at events has a weight of between 1.1-1.8 lbs. (~0.5-0.8 kg) and has text marking along the length of the pipe that may vary in color.\n\nTeams should be aware that CORAL and PVC pipe from different sources may have variances in color, markings, and weight.\n\nCORAL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a CORAL that still appears to look approximately like a CORAL is considered a CORAL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether damaged or not. Small chunks of a CORAL are not considered a CORAL.\n\nThe edge of the CORAL may be rough or sharp. Teams should use caution when handling CORAL.\n\n### 5.7.2       ALGAE\n\nFigure 5‑20: ALGAE\n\n![Figure showing ALGAE.](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image029.png)\n\nEach ALGAE is a 16.25 in. (~413 mm) ± ¼ in. (~6 mm) diameter rubber playground ball. The ball is custom made for _FIRST_ by Baden Sports and sold by AndyMark [am-5602](https://www.andymark.com/RS25GP2).\n\nPrior to Kickoff, ALGAE was known as “Game Piece 2” and was available for pre-order prior to the season.\n\nAt events, ALGAE will be inflated using a sizing gauge so that the diameter measures between 16 in. (~406 mm) and 16.5 in. (~419 mm). The ALGAE and the jig will both be placed on a flat surface, and the ALGAE will be inflated with the valve sticking up vertically so that the seam is perpendicular to the large hole in the jig. It will be inflated until the two opposite points along the seam are contacting the top edge of the hole in the jig, which is 16.25 in. (~413 mm) diameter.\n\nThe tolerances to which ALGAE are manufactured allow for variances in diameter, wall thickness, weight distribution and overall weight. They may not always be uniformly spherical, roll straight, or bounce as expected.\n\nFigure 5‑21 ALGAE Inflation Jig\n\n![A green ball on a metal stand\nDescription automatically generated](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image030.jpg)",

			"markdownContent": "6.2        DRIVE TEAM\n---------------------\n\nA DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same _FIRST_ Robotics Competition team responsible for team performance for a specific MATCH. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES can use to assist ROBOTS with REEFSCAPE, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-STUDENT.\n\nThe intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules is that, barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of people who arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are responsible for their team’s and ROBOT’S performance at the event (this means a person may be affiliated with more than 1 team). The intent is not to allow teams to “adopt” members of other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning team, borrowing team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes 1 of their DRIVERS has more experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and the teams agree the first pick team will “adopt” that DRIVER and make them a member of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs).\n\nThe definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to avoid additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g. requiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before allowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for exceptional circumstances that give teams the opportunity to display _Gracious Professionalism_ (e.g. a bus is delayed, a COACH has no DRIVERS, and their pit neighbors agree to help by loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team until their bus arrives).\n\nTable 6‑1 DRIVE TEAM roles\n\n**Role**\n\n**Description**\n\n**Max./**\n\n**DRIVE TEAM**\n\n**Criteria**\n\n**COACH**\n\na guide or advisor\n\n1\n\nany team member, must wear “COACH” button\n\n**TECHNICIAN**\n\na resource for ROBOT troubleshooting, setup, and removal from the FIELD\n\n1\n\nany team member, must wear “TECHNICIAN” button\n\n**DRIVER**\n\nan operator and controller of the ROBOT\n\n3\n\nSTUDENT, must wear a “DRIVE TEAM” button\n\n**HUMAN PLAYER**\n\na SCORING ELEMENT manager\n\nA STUDENT is a person who has not completed high-school, secondary school, or the comparable level as of September 1 prior to Kickoff.\n\nThe TECHNICIAN provides teams with a technical resource for pre-MATCH setup, ROBOT connectivity, OPERATOR CONSOLE troubleshooting, and post-MATCH removal of the ROBOT.

The intent is not to allow\nteams to “adopt” members of other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning\nteam, borrowing team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes\n1 of their DRIVERS has more experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and\nthe teams agree the first pick team will “adopt” that DRIVER and make them a\nmember of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs). \n\nThe definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to\navoid additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g.\nrequiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before\nallowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for exceptional\ncircumstances that give teams the opportunity to display Gracious\nProfessionalism (e.g. a bus is delayed, a COACH has no DRIVERS, and their\npit neighbors agree to help by loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team\nuntil their bus arrives).\n\n",

			"markdownContent": "6.3        Setup\n----------------\n\nBefore each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING ELEMENTS. DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOTS (as described in section 6.3.3 ROBOTS) and OPERATOR CONSOLES (as described in section 6.3.2 OPERATOR CONSOLES). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as described in section 6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS.\n\n### 6.3.1       DRIVE TEAMS\n\nDRIVE TEAMS prepare for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas, according to their role on the DRIVE TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating G301.\n\nA.      only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present,\n\nB.      For QUALIFICATION and PLAYOFF MATCHES only DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have passed initial, complete Inspection are present,\n\nC.      1 HUMAN PLAYER must be staged in their PROCESSOR AREA,\n\nD.      any number of HUMAN PLAYERS are staged in their CORAL STATION AREAS,\n\nE.      HUMAN PLAYERS not included in C or D, DRIVERS, and COACHES are in their ALLIANCE AREA and behind the HUMAN STARTING LINE,\n\nF.      TECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD,\n\nG.     DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their waists (COACH - “Coach”, DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”, and TECHNICIAN - “Technician”), and\n\nH.     if a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their designated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband).\n\n### 6.3.2       OPERATOR CONSOLES\n\nDRIVE TEAMS set up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from the previous MATCH has cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant rules, specifically those in section 8.9 OPERATOR CONSOLE. The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the team’s assigned DRIVER STATION, as indicated on the team sign. Any control devices worn or held by their HUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS during the MATCH must be disconnected from or set on or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can begin. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating G301.\n\nFor the purposes of _FIRST_ Robotics Competition, any device connected to the OPERATOR CONSOLE is considered a control device because REFEREES are not expected to differentiate between devices that can or cannot control the ROBOT.\n\n### 6.3.3       ROBOTS\n\nDRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOT in accordance with G303. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying ROBOT setup requirements is at risk of violating G301.\n\nIf order of placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES, the ALLIANCE notifies the Head REFEREE during setup for that MATCH, and the Head REFEREE instructs ALLIANCES to alternate placement of ROBOTS. In a Qualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in the following order:\n\n1.      red DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT\n\n2.      blue DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT\n\n3.      red DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT\n\n4.      blue DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT\n\n5.      red DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT\n\n6.      blue DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT\n\nIn an intra-Division Playoff MATCH, the same pattern is applied, but instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the higher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division Playoff MATCHES, the ALLIANCE that places last is determined by a (real or virtual) coin flip facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a “heads” result invites the red ALLIANCE to place last.\n\nFIELD STAFF may ask teams to indicate their intended location and are not required to wait for a team to stage their ROBOT in its exact location before moving to the next team.\n\n### 6.3.4       SCORING ELEMENTS\n\nBefore each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS.\n\nFigure 6‑2 CORAL MARK locations and SCORING ELEMENT staging positions\n\n![Figure showing CORAL and ALGAE locations on the field. ](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image038.png)\n\n#### 6.3.4.1        CORAL\n\n126 CORAL are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):\n\nA.      1 CORAL is staged on each CORAL MARK (6 total, CORAL are staged such that each CORAL covers the opposite ends of each CORAL MARK),\n\nB.      1 CORAL may be preloaded in each ROBOT by the ROBOT’S DRIVE TEAM, such that the CORAL is fully supported by the ROBOT (up to 6 total, a CORAL not pre-loaded in a ROBOT is staged with CORAL in the corresponding ALLIANCE AREA), and\n\nC.      remaining CORAL are split evenly behind each CORAL STATION (57 to 60 per ALLIANCE, depending on how many are preloaded in ROBOTS).\n\n#### 6.3.4.2        ALGAE\n\n18 ALGAE are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):\n\nA.      6 ALGAE are staged on pairs of BRANCHES as shown in Figure 6‑3 (12 total) such that they are placed lightly onto the REEF, and\n\nB.      1 ALGAE is placed on top of each CORAL staged on a CORAL MARK (6 total).\n\nStaged ALGAE will not contact CORAL placed on L4.\n\nFigure 6‑3 Staging positions for ALGAE on a REEF\n\n![Figure showing ALGAE staging locations on the REEF. ](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image039.png)\n\n### 6.3.5       CAGES\n\nEach team can choose the height of the CAGE closest to their driver station. By default, all CAGES are left in the state from the last match. At the start of each day, all CAGES are set as deep CAGES. If a team would like to alter the CAGE height they must alert the FIELD STAFF during reset.

			"markdownContent": "6.5        Scoring\n------------------\n\nALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions throughout a MATCH, including LEAVING their ROBOT STARTING LINE, scoring CORAL on their REEF, scoring ALGAE in their PROCESSOR and NET, climbing CAGES, and winning or tying MATCHES.\n\nRewards are granted either via MATCH points, _Coopertition_ points, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, which increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).\n\nAll scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH, except as follows:\n\nA.      assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO.\n\nB.      assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP.\n\nC.      assessment of CAGE points is made 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH, whichever happens first.\n\nLEAVING the ROBOT STARTING LINE, CORAL scoring, ALGAE scoring in the NET, PARKING and CAGE points are all evaluated and scored by human volunteers. Teams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the criteria are met.\n\n### 6.5.1       SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria\n\nA CORAL is scored in the trough (L1) of the REEF if it is not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE, not scored on any other level of the REEF, and\n\nA.      contacting the trough, or\n\nB.      directly supported (either fully or partially) by a CORAL in contact with the trough.\n\nFigure 6‑5 Examples of CORAL scored in the trough (L1)\n\n![Figure showing examples of CORAL scored in the trough(L1). ](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image041.png)\n\nFigure 6‑5 includes examples of CORAL on the REEF at the conclusion of a MATCH.\n\nA.      CORAL A, C, F, and H are scored because they meet criteria A.\n\nB.      CORAL B and G are scored because they meet criteria B.\n\nC.      CORAL D and E do not meet any criteria for trough scoring.\n\nA CORAL is scored on L2-L4 BRANCH if the BRANCH is inside the volume of the CORAL and the CORAL is not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE or an ALGAE. Only 1 CORAL can be scored per BRANCH.\n\nAn ALGAE is scored in a PROCESSOR once it has passed through the opening of the PROCESSOR and by the sensor array. An ALGAE is scored in a NET if it is above the NET and within the perimeter of the NET, contacting the NET or ALGAE contacting the NET, and not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE.\n\nIf a CORAL scored in AUTO gets removed from a BRANCH during TELEOP, the AUTO points are removed but the CORAL will still count towards the AUTO RP. If a CORAL is scored in that location again, the AUTO points associated with the original scored CORAL is restored. CORAL scored in the trough is not tracked by specific location, if a CORAL is removed from the trough after AUTO, the points removed will correspond to the lowest scoring CORAL (i.e. TELEOP CORAL removed first); if CORAL is re-scored in the trough, points will be re-added in the reverse order (i.e. AUTO CORAL re-added first).\n\n### 6.5.2       ROBOT Scoring Criteria\n\nTo qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT must move such that its BUMPERS no longer overlap its ROBOT STARTING LINE at the end of AUTO.\n\nTo qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must be partially or completely contained in their BARGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH and does not meet the criteria for CAGE points.\n\nTo qualify for CAGE points, a ROBOT must be contacting one and only one of their ALLIANCE’S CAGES (and not touching any ANCHOR), not contacting the carpet, and may additionally contact only the following elements:\n\nA.      SCORING ELEMENTS,\n\nB.      another ROBOT qualified for CAGE points,\n\nC.      a partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G428, and\n\nD.      an opponent ROBOT.\n\n### 6.5.3       _Coopertition_ Bonus\n\nIn Qualification MATCHES, if at least 2 ALGAE are scored in each ALLIANCE’S PROCESSOR, all teams earn 1 _Coopertition_ Point, and the threshold for the CORAL RP decreases as described in Table 6‑2.\n\nSee section 10.5.3 Qualification Ranking for more information about _Coopertition_ influence on Qualification Ranking order.  \n  \n\n  \n\n### 6.5.4       Point Values\n\nPoint values for tasks in REEFSCAPE are detailed in Table 6‑2.\n\nTable 6‑2 REEFSCAPE point values\n\n**MATCH points**\n\n**Ranking Points**\n\n**_Coopertition_ Points**\n\n**AUTO**\n\n**TELEOP**\n\n**LEAVE**\n\n3\n\n**CORAL**\n\nCORAL scored in trough (L1)\n\n3\n\n2\n\nCORAL scored on L2 BRANCH\n\n4\n\n3\n\nCORAL scored on L3 BRANCH\n\n6\n\n4\n\nCORAL scored on L4 BRANCH\n\n7\n\n5\n\n**ALGAE**\n\nscored in PROCESSOR\n\n6\n\n6\n\nscored in NET\n\n4\n\n4\n\n**BARGE**\n\nPARK in the BARGE ZONE\n\n2\n\noff-the-ground via shallow CAGE\n\n6\n\noff-the-ground via deep CAGE\n\n12\n\n**_Coopertition_ Bonus** – at least 2 ALGAE scored in each PROCESSOR\n\n1\n\n**AUTO RP** - all non-BYPASSED ROBOTS LEAVE and at least 1 CORAL scored in AUTO\n\n1\n\n**\\*CORAL RP** - If at least 7 CORAL scored on each level.\n\nIf _Coopertition_ achieved, at least 7 CORAL must be scored on each of 3 levels.\n\n1\n\n**\\*BARGE RP** - at least 16 BARGE points are scored\n\n1\n\n**Win**\n\ncompleting a MATCH with more MATCH points than your opponent\n\n3\n\n**Tie**\n\ncompleting a MATCH with the same number of MATCH points as your opponent\n\n1\n\n\\*For District Championship and/or _FIRST_ Championship events, the CORAL or BARGE RP requirement may increase.",

This overrides any RP awarded through normal MATCH play or other rule violations.\n\n### 6.6.1       YELLOW and RED CARDS\n\nIn addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout this document, YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are used in _FIRST_ Robotics Competition to address team and ROBOT behavior that does not align with the mission, values, and culture of _FIRST_.\n\nThe Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a RED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a _FIRST_ Robotics Competition event.\n\nA YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air while the Game Announcer describes the violation.\n\nYELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD is automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent MATCHES, except as noted below.\n\nOnce a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, a yellow rectangle will show next to the team number on the audience display during subsequent MATCHES, including any replays.\n\nFigure 6‑6 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD indicators\n\n![Example audience display graphic showing YELLOW CARD indicators. ](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image042.png)\n\nAll YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of Practice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. VERBAL WARNINGS issued by the head REFEREE are cleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through subsequent tournament phases.\n\n### 6.6.2       YELLOW and RED CARD application\n\nYELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following:\n\nTable 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application\n\n**Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:**\n\n**MATCH to which CARD is applied:**\n\n**Prior to Qualification MATCHES**\n\nREFEREES may or may not be present during Practice MATCHES. With input from event staff, The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a VERBAL WARNING or YELLOW CARD earned prior to Qualification MATCHES to the first Qualification MATCH for particularly egregious behavior.\n\n**during the Qualification MATCHES**\n\nteam’s current (or just-completed) MATCH. In the case where the team participated as a SURROGATE in the current (or just completed) MATCH, the card is applied to the team’s previous MATCH (i.e. the team’s second Qualification MATCH)\n\n**between the end of Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES**\n\nALLIANCE’S first Playoff MATCH\n\n**during the Playoff MATCHES**\n\nALLIANCE’S current (or just-completed) MATCH\n\nPlease see examples of the application of YELLOW and RED CARDS as shown in section 6.6.4 Violation Details.\n\n### 6.6.3       YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES\n\nDuring Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the violating team’s entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If an ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES receive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically, is DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH.\n\n### 6.6.4       Violation Details\n\nThere are several styles of violation wording used in this manual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the violation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible violations, but rather a representative set of combinations.\n\nTable 6‑5 Violation examples\n\n**Example Violation**\n\n**Expanded Interpretation**\n\n**MINOR FOUL**\n\nUpon violation, a MINOR FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE.\n\n**MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD**\n\nUpon violation, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team with a YELLOW CARD.\n\n**MINOR FOUL per additional SCORING ELEMENT. If egregious, YELLOW CARD**\n\nUpon violation, a number of MINOR FOULS are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of additional SCORING ELEMENTS beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine that the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team with a YELLOW CARD after the MATCH.\n\n**MINOR FOUL. MAJOR FOUL IF REPEATED**\n\nUpon initial violation in a MATCH, a MINOR FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction in the MATCH, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in that MATCH, the ROBOT has “earned” a MINOR FOUL and a MAJOR FOUL for their ALLIANCE.\n\n**MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed**\n\nUpon violation, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to count. Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met, and for each 3 seconds within that time, an additional MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this type of rule for 15 seconds receives a total of 6 MAJOR FOULS (assuming no other rules were being simultaneously violated).\n\n**RED CARD for the ALLIANCE**\n\nAfter the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating ALLIANCE with a RED CARD in the following fashion:\n\n·         In a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.\n\n·         In all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD.",

			"markdownContent": "**G301**       \\*Be prompt. A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant delays to the start of their MATCH. Causing a significant delay requires both of the following to be true:\n\nA.      The expected MATCH start time has passed, and\n\nEvent volunteers communicate schedule delays with teams to the best of their ability. The Pit Display (which is typically located near the Pit Administration desk) shows any event timing delay. Announcements on the FIELD and in the pits also provide information on delays, and any team uncertain of when to queue for a MATCH should communicate with queuing volunteers.\n\nDuring Qualification MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH schedule or the cycle time for current round minus 3 minutes from the end of the previous MATCH (which is reflected on the schedule on the Pit Display), whichever is later.\n\nDuring Playoff MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH schedule or 15 minutes from either ALLIANCE’S previous MATCH, whichever is later.\n\nB.      The DRIVE TEAM has access to the FIELD and is neither MATCH ready nor making a good faith effort, to quickly become MATCH ready.\n\nTeams that have violated G208 or have 1 DRIVE TEAM member present and have informed event staff that their ROBOT will not be participating in the MATCH are considered MATCH ready and not in violation of this rule.\n\nViolation: If a Qualification MATCH, VERBAL WARNING, or if a subsequent violation within the tournament phase, MAJOR FOUL applied to their upcoming MATCH.

The total applicable cost for the part\nwould be $400 USD.\n\nExample 6: A team purchases a widget at a garage sale or\nonline auction for $300, but it’s available for sale from a VENDOR for $700.\nThe FMV is $700.\n\nIf a COTS item is part of a modular system that can be\nassembled in several possible configurations, then each individual module must\nfit within the price constraints defined in this rule. \n\nIf the modules are designed to assemble into a single\nconfiguration, and the assembly is functional in only that configuration, then\nthe total cost of the complete assembly including all modules must fit within\nthe price constraints defined in this rule.\n\nIn summary, if a VENDOR sells a system or a kit, a team\nmust use the entire system/kit FMV and not the value of its COMPONENT pieces.\n\nExample 7: VENDOR A sells a gearbox that can be used with a\nnumber of different gear sets, and can mate with 2 different motors they sell.\nA team purchases the gearbox, a gear set, and a motor, then assembles them\ntogether. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining FMV\nsince the purchased pieces can each be used in various configurations.\n\nExample 8: VENDOR B sells a robotic arm assembly that a\nteam wants to use. However, it costs $630 USD, so they cannot use it. The\nVENDOR sells the “hand”, “wrist”, and “arm” as separate assemblies, for $210\nUSD each. A team wishes to purchase the 3 items separately, then reassemble\nthem. This would not be legal, as they are really buying and using the entire\nassembly, which has a Fair Market Value of $630 USD.\n\nExample 9: VENDOR C sells a set of wheels or wheel modules\nthat are often used in groups of 4. The wheels or modules can be used in other\nquantities or configurations. A team purchases 4 and uses them in the most\ncommon configuration. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of\ndetermining FMV, since the purchased pieces can be used in various\nconfigurations.\n\n",

Each Qualification schedule consists of a series of rounds in which each team plays 1 MATCH per round.\n\n### 10.5.2   MATCH Assignment\n\nFMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each Qualification MATCH using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch Qualification MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria, listed in order of priority:\n\n1.      ensure each team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by event size)\n\n2.      minimize the number of times a team is allied with any team\n\n3.      minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team\n\n4.      minimize the use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to play an extra Qualification MATCH)\n\n5.      provide even distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE\n\n6.      provide even distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number\n\nFor more information about the MATCH scheduling algorithm, please see [Idle Loop software’s website](https://idleloop.com/matchmaker/).\n\nAt events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the criteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of times a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even distribution.\n\nAll teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES, equal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number of MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some teams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those teams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH as a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third Qualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team’s ranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward to subsequent MATCHES.\n\n### 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking\n\nRanking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S performance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each eligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per Table 6‑2.\n\nExceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows:\n\nA.      A SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points.\n\nB.      A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0 Ranking Points.\n\nC.      A “no-show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for that MATCH (see G208).

			"markdownContent": "11.1   District Events\n----------------------\n\nDistrict teams are ranked throughout the season based on the points they earn at the first 2 home District events they attend, as well as at their District Championship. Points are awarded to teams as follows:\n\nTable 11‑1 District Point Assignment\n\n**Category**\n\n**Points**\n\n**Qualification Round Performance**\n\n![](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image065.png)\n\n![](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image066.png)\n\n(For a typically sized District event, this will result in a minimum of 4 points being awarded for Qualification round performance. For events of all sizes, a maximum of 22 points will be awarded.)\n\n**ALLIANCE CAPTAINS**\n\nEqual to 17 minus the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN number (e.g. 14 points for ALLIANCE #3 Captain)\n\n**Draft Order Acceptance**\n\nEqual to 17 minus the Draft Order Acceptance Number (e.g. 12 points for the team that accepts the fifth draft position, regardless of whether it was delayed per T605.)\n\n**Playoff Advancement**\n\nPoints awarded based on team participation in individual playoff rounds, and whether or not the ALLIANCE advances. See section 11.1.3 Playoff Performance for details.\n\n**Judged Team Awards**\n\n10 points for _FIRST_ Impact Award\n\n8 points each for Engineering Inspiration and Rookie All Star Awards\n\n5 points each for all other judged team awards\n\n**Team Age**\n\n10 points for 2025 rookie teams\n\n5 points for 2024 rookie teams\n\nPoints earned at District Championships are multiplied by 3 and then added to points earned at District events, to determine the final season point total for the team.\n\nIf there is a tie in the season point total between teams, the higher ranked team will be determined using the following additional sorting criteria:\n\nTable 11‑2 District team sort criteria\n\n**Order Sort**\n\n**Criteria**\n\n**1st**\n\nTotal Playoff Performance Points\n\n**2nd**\n\nBest Playoff Points at a single event\n\n**3rd**\n\nTotal ALLIANCE Selection Results Points\n\n**4th**\n\nHighest Qualification Round Seed or Draft Order Acceptance (i.e. Highest ALLIANCE Selection points at a single event)\n\n**5th**\n\nTotal Qualification Round Performance Points\n\n**6th**\n\nHighest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH\n\n**7th**\n\nSecond highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH\n\n**8th**\n\nThird highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH\n\n**9th**\n\nRandom Selection\n\n### 11.1.1   Qualification Round Performance\n\nThe calculation of Qualification performance points is done using the equation (an inverse error function) in Table 11‑1. The equation utilizes the following variables:\n\n\\-        R – the qualification rank of the team at the event at the conclusion of Qualification MATCHES (as reported by FMS)\n\n\\-        N – the number of _FIRST_ Robotics Competition teams participating in the Qualification rounds at the event\n\n\\-        Alpha (α) – a static value (1.07) used to standardize the distribution of points at events\n\nThis formula generates an approximately normal distribution of Qualification Round Performance points at an event, based on rank, with most teams getting a moderate number of points, and fewer teams getting the highest or lowest numbers of points available.\n\nTable 11‑3 displays sample Qualification Round Performance points for variously ranked teams at a 40-team event. The system will automatically generate the appropriate points for each team based on their rank and the number of teams at the event.\n\nTable 11‑3 Sample Qualification Round point assignments\n\n**Rank**\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n…\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n…\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n**Points**\n\n22\n\n21\n\n20\n\n19\n\n…\n\n13\n\n13\n\n12\n\n…\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n### 11.1.2   ALLIANCE Selection Results\n\nThis attribute measures both individual team qualification round seeding performance and recognition by peers.\n\nALLIANCE CAPTAINS are recognized based on their qualification round seeding rank. This rank is a result of the rules of the game, which typically incorporate several team performance attributes, and are designed to eliminate ties in rank. Non-ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are rewarded based on peer recognition. To be invited to join an ALLIANCE, a team’s peers have decided that the team has attributes that are desirable. Giving points for ALLIANCE selection also supports come-from-behind teams. A team taking several MATCHES to optimize their performance may be recognized as a late bloomer by a top seeded team, even if that performance isn’t reflected in the rankings because of poor performance in early MATCHES. These points also have the potential to recognize teams employing a minority strategy with their ROBOT. Teams with unique or divergent ROBOT capabilities that complement the strengths of other ALLIANCE members may be selected to fill a strategic niche.\n\nNote also that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are given the same number of points as the team drafted in the same sequence. For example, the third ALLIANCE CAPTAIN gets the same number of points as the third draft. Numerical analysis supports the idea that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are about as strong in ROBOT performance as equivalently drafted teams. As an additional minor benefit, awarding the same points for ALLIANCE CAPTAINS and equivalent drafts lubricates the acceptance of draft offers between ALLIANCE CAPTAINS, which gives teams out of the top 8 the chance to experience being ALLIANCE CAPTAINS themselves.\n\n### 11.1.3   Playoff Performance\n\nThis attribute measures team performance as part of an ALLIANCE.\n\nTeams that advance to at least MATCH 12 earn Double Elimination (DE) Points per the formula below, where β is defined in Table 11‑4.\n\n![](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2025/Manual/HTML/2025GameManual_files/image067.png)\n\nTable 11‑4 Double Elimination Points, β values\n\n**ALLIANCE Finish**\n\n**β**\n\n**1st Place (Winners)**\n\n20\n\n**2nd Place (Finalists)**\n\n20\n\n**3rd Place (loser of MATCH 13)**\n\n13\n\n**4th Place (loser of MATCH 12)**\n\n7\n\nIn most cases, unless a BACKUP is recruited, a team plays 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, thus their DE Points simply equal β. If a team does not play 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, their DE Points equal their β value multiplied by the percentage of DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE in which that team participated. If the result is not a whole number, the value is rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\nTeams on the winning ALLIANCE are awarded additional Finals Points, which are 5 points for each Finals MATCH won and in which the team participated, up to a maximum of 10 points.\n\nFor example, if Team X’s ALLIANCE wins the event, but Team X only played in 2 MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, MATCH 13 and Final 1, Team X’s Playoff Performance points are 20 \\* (1/5) + 5 = 9 points.\n\nThe maximum number of Playoff Performance Points a team can earn is 30 (20 DE points + 10 Finals Points).\n\n### 11.1.4   Awards\n\nThis attribute measures team performance with respect to team awards judged at the event.\n\nThe points earned for team awards in this system are not intended to capture the full value of the award to the team winning the award, or to represent the full value of the award to _FIRST_. In many ways, the team’s experience in being selected for awards, especially the _FIRST_ Impact Award, the Engineering Inspiration Award, and the Rookie All Star Award (which is optional for District Championship events), is beyond measure, and could not be fully captured in its entirety by any points-based system. Points are being assigned to awards in this system only to help teams recognize that _FIRST_ continues to be “_More than Robots®_,” with the emphasis on our cultural awards, and to assist in elevating award-winning teams above non-award-winning teams in the ranking system.\n\nTeams only get points for team awards judged at the event. If an award is not judged, is not for a team (e.g. the Dean’s List Award) or is not judged at the event (e.g. Safety Animation Award, sponsored by UL), no points are earned.\n\n### 11.1.5   Team Age\n\nThis attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively new team.\n\nPoints are awarded to 2024 and 2025 rookie teams in recognition of the unique challenges teams face in those early years, and to increase the chance that they will make it to the District Championship to compete with their ROBOTS. Like our dedicated Rookie awards, these additional points are intended to recognize and motivate newer participants in _FIRST_ Robotics Competition. These points are awarded once at the beginning of the season. Rookie year is calculated based on the year in which _FIRST_ recognizes the team as a rookie.\n\n### 11.1.6   Regional Participation\n\nDistrict teams neither earn points for their actions at any Regionals, nor are eligible for any _FIRST_ Championship qualifying benefits at that Regional (awards, etc.).",

Points are assigned to awards to recognize that _FIRST_ continues to be “More than Robots®” and to elevate award-winning teams above non-award-winning teams in the ranking system. These points are not intended to capture the true value of these awards as that value is truly immeasurable.\n\nPoint values for some culture awards (_FIRST_ Impact Award, Engineering Inspiration) are higher for Regional events than District events because Districts reward those teams with slots at an intermediate level of competition: their District Championship. Regional teams do not have an intermediate competition level and _FIRST_ wants those teams to have an opportunity to share their stories and celebrate their success outside of their regional event.\n\n### 12.1.2   Team Age\n\nThis attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively new team.\n\nMuch of what is stated in section 11.1.5 Team Age is also relevant to Regional events. Points are awarded to 2024 and 2025 rookie teams. Unlike in the District events where these points are awarded once per season, for Regional events these points are awarded at each event they attend. Awarding these points at every event will assist rookies with earning one of the three per-event qualification slots starting in 2026. Rookie year is calculated based on the year in which _FIRST_ recognizes the team as a rookie.",
