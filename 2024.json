It consists of 3 DRIVER STATIONS and the vertical surfaces behind the SUBWOOFER.\n\n### 5.6.1      SPEAKER\n\nFigure 5‑14 SPEAKER\n\n[![P382#yIS1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image021.png)](https://youtu.be/XOdxXNeCXKQ)\n\nA SPEAKER consists of a SUBWOOFER and all elements above and behind the ALLIANCE WALL. The SPEAKER features an opening through which ROBOTS score NOTES. The opening is bounded by SPEAKER components and the top of the ALLIANCE WALL. The lowest edge of the SPEAKER opening is 6 ft. 6 in. (~198 cm) from the carpet, and the highest edge of the opening is 6 ft. 10⅞ in. (~211 cm) above the carpet. The opening is 3 ft. 5⅜ in. (~105 cm) wide and extends 1 ft. 6 in. (~46 cm) into the FIELD. The plane of the opening is at a 14° upward angle relative to the carpet. The roof inside the SPEAKER forms a concave surface against which NOTES bounce.\n\nFigure 5‑15 SUBWOOFER\n\n![P385#yIS1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image022.jpg)\n\nThe SUBWOOFER is a 6-faced element centered below each SPEAKER and positioned against the ALLIANCE WALL. The SUBWOOFER is 3 ft. 1 in. (~94 cm) tall and the vertical panels are 8⅜ in. (~21 cm) tall. The SUBWOOFER extends 3 ft. ⅛ in. (~92 cm) from the ALLIANCE WALL. Vertical faces are black HDPE, the side inclined faces are ALLIANCE\\-colored HDPE, and the center inclined panels are vinyl-coated polycarbonate.\n\nLights indicate if the SPEAKER is AMPLIFIED and if so, how much AMPLIFICATION time remains. Light strings in the top of the SPEAKER match the ALLIANCE color and turn on if the SPEAKER is AMPLIFIED. ALLIANCE colored lights in the SUBWOOFER turn on when AMPLIFICATION starts and recede, second by second, as AMPLIFICATION progresses, and if AMPLIFICATION ends before the countdown completes (because the maximum number of NOTES have been scored), the SUBWOOFER and SPEAKER lights turn off. \n\n### 5.6.2      DRIVER STATIONS\n\nFigure 5‑16 DRIVER STATION (ALLIANCE AREA perspective and FIELD perspective)\n\n![P390#yIS1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image023.jpg)\n\nA DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3 assemblies within an ALLIANCE WALL behind which a DRIVE TEAM operates their ROBOT. Each DRIVER STATION is made from a 3 ft. ¾ in. (~93 cm) tall diamond plate base topped with a 3 ft. 6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top rail. An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER STATION to support an OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. ¼ in. (~31 cm) deep. There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hook-and-loop tape (loop side) along the center of the support shelf that may be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf.\n\nThere may be a ramp available at events for DRIVE TEAMS with limited mobility. It is specially designed to allow an individual using a wheelchair to access the DRIVER STATION shelf and/or see onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who using a wheelchair or other physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to ensure that it is available for each of the teams MATCHES.\n\nThis ramp is available at many Regional and District events. For questions please connect with the local [Program Delivery Partner](https://www.firstinspires.org/find-local-support).\n\nEach DRIVER STATION contains the following elements for DRIVE TEAMS:\n\n\\-       1 Ethernet cable: attaches to the Ethernet port of the OPERATOR CONSOLE and provides connectivity to the FIELD Management System (FMS)\n\n\\-       1 120VAC NEMA 5-15R power outlet (i.e. standard US outlet): located on each DRIVER STATION shelf and protected by its own 2-Amp circuit breaker. It can be used to power the OPERATOR CONSOLE. DRIVE TEAMS are responsible for monitoring their power consumption as a tripped breaker in the outlet does not constitute an ARENA FAULT. For some events in regions that dont use NEMA 5-15 shaped outlets, event organizers may install appropriate plug adapters to be used throughout the event.\n\n\\-       1 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to deactivate a ROBOT in an emergency\n\n\\-       1 Autonomous Stop (A-Stop) button: located on the right side of the DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to DISABLE a ROBOT during AUTO\n\n\\-       1 team sign: located at the top of each DRIVER STATION. The FIELD facing side of the sign displays the team number in the ALLIANCE color. The ALLIANCE AREA side of the sign displays the following information in red:  \n\no   Pre-MATCH: team number and ROBOT connection state\n\no   During the MATCH:\n\n§  progress toward RP threshold (n/a during the Playoff Tournament),\n\n§  time remaining in AMPLIFICATION, and\n\n§  remaining MATCH period time.\n\n\\-       1 timer (in DRIVER STATION 2 only): displays the official time remaining in the MATCH period on the FIELD\\-facing side (in white) and official time remaining in the MATCH period and MATCH scores on the ALLIANCE AREA facing side (in red).\n\n\\-       1 team LED stack: indicates ALLIANCE color, ROBOT status, E-Stop and A-Stop status, and is centered at the top of each DRIVER STATION.\n\nThe stack includes 2 identical ALLIANCE\\-colored ROBOT status LEDs above a third amber A-stop/E-stop LED. LED states are as follows:\n\no   ROBOT status LEDs\n\n§  Solid: indicates that the ROBOT is connected and enabled. This only happens during a MATCH.\n\n§  Blinking: indicates that either the FMS is preset for the MATCH and the ROBOT is not connected yet, or its during a MATCH and the corresponding ROBOT is BYPASSED, has lost connectivity, or the E-stop was pressed.\n\n§  Off: indicates that the ROBOT is linked and DISABLED prior to the start of the MATCH. This light is also off, regardless of ROBOT connection status, after the MATCH has concluded.\n\no   A-Stop/E-stop LED\n\n§  Solid: the ROBOT is DISABLED due to a press of the team E-stop button, the FIELD E-stop button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS.\n\n§  Blinking: the ROBOT is DISABLED for the remainder of AUTO due to a press of the team A-Stop button.\n\n§  Off: the ROBOT is not DISABLED by the FIELD.\n\n\\-       FMS hardware and wiring: mostly located below shelves in the 2 DRIVER STATIONS closer to the scoring table.",

The intent is not to allow\nteams to adopt members of other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning\nteam, borrowing team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes\n1 of their DRIVERS has more experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and\nthe teams agree the first pick team will adopt that DRIVER and make them a\nmember of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs). \n\nThe definition isnt stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to\navoid additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g.\nrequiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before\nallowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for exceptional\ncircumstances that give teams the opportunity to display Gracious\nProfessionalism (e.g. a bus is delayed, a COACH has no DRIVERS, and their\npit neighbors agree to help by loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team\nuntil their bus arrives).\n\n",

			"markdownContent": "6.3      Setup\n--------------\n\nBefore each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES as described in [Section 6.3.4 GAME PIECES](#_GAME_PIECES). DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOTS (as described in [Section 6.3.3 ROBOTS](#_ROBOTS_1)) and OPERATOR CONSOLES (as described in [Section 6.3.2 OPERATOR CONSOLES](#_OPERATOR_CONSOLES)). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as described in [Section 6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS](#_DRIVE_TEAMS).\n\n### 6.3.1      DRIVE TEAMS\n\nDRIVE TEAMS prepare for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas, according to their role on the DRIVE TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating [G301](https://frctools.com/2024/G301).\n\nA.     only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present,\n\nB.     only DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have passed initial, complete Inspection are present,  \n\nC.     SOURCE AREA HUMAN PLAYERS are behind the STARTING LINE,\n\nD.     ALLIANCE AREA DRIVE TEAM members are behind the STARTING LINE,\n\nE.     TECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD,\n\nF.     DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their waists (COACH - Coach, DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS - Drive Team, and TECHNICIAN - Technician), and\n\nG.     if a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their designated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband).\n\n### 6.3.2      OPERATOR CONSOLES\n\nDRIVE TEAMS set up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from the previous MATCH has cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant rules, specifically those in [Section 8.9 OPERATOR CONSOLE](#_OPERATOR_CONSOLE). The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the teams assigned DRIVER STATION, as indicated on the team sign. Any control devices worn or held by their HUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS during the MATCH must be disconnected from or set on or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can begin. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating [G301](https://frctools.com/2024/G301).\n\nFor the purposes of _FIRST_ Robotics Competition, any device connected to the OPERATOR CONSOLE is considered a control device because REFEREES are not expected to differentiate between devices that can or cannot control the ROBOT.\n\n### 6.3.3      ROBOTS\n\nDRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOT in accordance with [G303](https://frctools.com/2024/G303). A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying ROBOT setup requirements is at risk of violating [G301](https://frctools.com/2024/G301).\n\nIf order of placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES, the ALLIANCE notifies the Head REFEREE during setup for that MATCH, and the Head REFEREE instructs ALLIANCES to alternate placement of ROBOTS. In a Qualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in the following order:\n\n1.     red DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT\n\n2.     blue DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT\n\n3.     red DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT\n\n4.     blue DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT\n\n5.     red DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT\n\n6.     blue DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT\n\nIn an intra-Division Playoff MATCH, the same pattern is applied, but instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the higher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division Playoff MATCHES, the ALLIANCE that places last is determined by a (real or virtual) coin flip facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a heads result invites the red ALLIANCE to place last.\n\n### 6.3.4      GAME PIECES\n\nBefore each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage GAME PIECES.\n\nFigure 6‑2 SPIKE MARK locations and GAME PIECE staging positions\n\n![P568#yIS1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image034.jpg)\n\n3 HIGH NOTES are staged on top of each AMP.\n\n107 NOTES are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):\n\nA.     90 NOTES are staged in the SOURCE AREAS (45 NOTES in each SOURCE AREA),\n\nB.     6 NOTES are staged on WING SPIKE MARKS (3 NOTES in each WING),\n\nC.     5 NOTES are staged on CENTER LINE SPIKE MARKS,\n\nD.     6 NOTES may be preloaded in ROBOTS, 1 per ROBOT, by the ROBOTS DRIVE TEAMS such that the NOTE is fully supported by the ROBOT. A NOTE not pre-loaded in a ROBOT is staged with NOTES in the ALLIANCES SOURCE AREA.\n\nNOTES on SPIKE MARKS are staged such that each NOTE covers the opposite ends of each SPIKE MARK.",

			"markdownContent": "6.5      Scoring\n----------------\n\nALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions through the course of a MATCH, including leaving their ROBOT STARTING ZONE, scoring NOTES in their SPEAKER and AMP, taking their STAGE, SPOTLIGHTING ONSTAGE ROBOTS by scoring HIGH NOTES, cooperating with their opponents, and winning or tying MATCHES.\n\nRewards are granted either via MATCH points, _Coopertition_ points, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, which increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).\n\nAll scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH, except as follows:\n\nA.     assessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO.\n\nB.     assessment of NOTES scored in SPEAKERS continues for up to 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP.\n\nC.     assessment of STAGE points is made 5 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH, whichever happens first.\n\n### 6.5.1      NOTE Scoring Criteria\n\nA NOTE is scored in a SPEAKER once it passes through the FIELD\\-facing opening of the SPEAKER and through the sensor array.\n\nA NOTE is scored in the AMP once it passes through the FIELD\\-facing opening of the AMP and through the sensor array.\n\nA NOTE is scored in the TRAP if it enters the TRAP from above (i.e. through the cutout above the AprilTag).\n\n### 6.5.2      ROBOT Scoring Criteria\n\nTo qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOTS BUMPERS must completely clear its ROBOT STARTING ZONE at any point during AUTO.\n\nTo qualify for PARK points, a ROBOTS BUMPERS must be partially or completely contained in the STAGE ZONE at the end of the MATCH (more specifically, per criteria described in [item C of Section 6.5 Scoring](#RobotAssessment)) and does not meet the criteria for ONSTAGE.\n\nTo qualify for ONSTAGE points, a ROBOT may only be contacting:\n\nA.     their truss legs (pink shaded elements in Figure 6‑3) via ROBOT BUMPERS,\n\nB.     GAME PIECES,\n\nC.     chain-facing vertical surfaces of their core or the nearest flap (with regards to the chain used by the ONSTAGE ROBOT, green shaded elements in Figure 6‑3),\n\nD.     carpet-facing surfaces of their core (blue shaded elements in Figure 6‑3), and\n\nE.     a single STAGE chain (on their STAGE) (highlighted in orange in in Figure 6‑3),\n\nF.     another ROBOT qualified for ONSTAGE points,\n\nG.     a partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of [G424](https://frctools.com/2024/G424), and\n\nH.    an opponent ROBOT.\n\nFigure 6‑3 Contact points for ONSTAGE scoring eligibility\n\n![P603#yIS1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image035.jpg)\n\nAn ALLIANCE achieves HARMONY if more than 1 ROBOT is ONSTAGE via direct or transitive support from a single chain. HARMONY points, as specified in Table 6‑2 are awarded per additional ROBOT.\n\nLEAVE and STAGE points are evaluated and scored by human REFEREES. Teams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that a ROBOT has met the criteria.\n\n### 6.5.3      AMPLIFICATION\n\nAMPLIFICATION increases the number of MATCH points awarded for NOTES scored in a SPEAKER per Table 6‑2. To AMPLIFY, an ALLIANCE must have at least 2 NOTES through their AMP. Once this criterion is met, the HUMAN PLAYER may press the AMP button which AMPLIFIES their SPEAKER for 10 seconds or until 4 NOTES are scored in that SPEAKER, whichever comes first. Due to NOTE transit time from the SPEAKER opening to the sensor array, there is a 3-second extension on the end of the nominal AMPLIFICATION time to account for NOTES that entered the SPEAKER within 10 seconds of the AMP button being pressed but havent yet been processed. An ALLIANCE must collect another 2 NOTES through their AMP after AMPLIFICATION ends before they are able to AMPLIFY their SPEAKER again. While NOTES delivered through the AMP after the 2-NOTE threshold is reached or during AMPLIFICATION do not contribute to the next AMPLIFICATION or _Coopertition_ requirement, they do earn MATCH points (in other words, and ALLIANCE can only bank up to 2 NOTES at a time toward AMPLIFICATION or _Cooperition_).\n\n### 6.5.4      SPOTLIGHTING\n\nALLIANCES may SPOTLIGHT ROBOTS by scoring a HIGH NOTE on a MICROPHONE. A HIGH NOTE is scored on the MICROPHONE if the NOTE surrounds, i.e. encircles, the MICROPHONE. Once a HIGH NOTE is scored on a MICROPHONE, ONSTAGE ROBOTS paired with (i.e. below) the MICROPHONE on which the HIGH NOTE was scored are awarded a greater number of points per Table 6‑2.\n\n### 6.5.5      _Coopertition_ Bonus\n\nIf both ALLIANCES use a NOTE scored in their AMP to engage in _Coopertition_ (by pressing their _Coopertition_ button) within the first 45 seconds of TELEOP (i.e. remaining MATCH time is greater than 1:30), all teams earn a _Coopertition_ Bonus, and the threshold for the MELODY decreases as described in Table 6‑2.\n\nA NOTE used for _Coopertition_ is no longer eligible for contribution to AMPLIFICATION.\n\nSee [Section 10.5.3 Qualification Ranking](#_Qualification_Ranking) for more information about _Coopertition_ influence on Qualification Ranking order.\n\nIn Playoff MATCHES, the _Coopertition_ button is unused.\n\n### 6.5.6      Point Values\n\nPoint values for tasks in CRESCENDO are detailed in Table 6‑2.\n\nTable 6‑2 CRESCENDO point values\n\n**MATCH points**\n\n**Ranking Points**\n\n**_Coopertition_ Points**\n\n**AUTO**\n\n**TELEOP**\n\n**LEAVE**\n\n2\n\n**NOTES**\n\nAMP NOTE\n\n2\n\n1\n\nSPEAKER NOTE (not AMPLIFIED)\n\n5\n\n2\n\nSPEAKER NOTE (AMPLIFIED)\n\n5\n\n**STAGE**\n\nPARK\n\n1\n\nONSTAGE (not SPOTLIT)\n\n3\n\nONSTAGE (SPOTLIT)\n\n4\n\nHARMONY\n\n2\n\nNOTE in TRAP (max. 1/TRAP)\n\n5\n\n**_Coopertition_ Bonus**\n\n1\n\n**MELODY**\n\nat least\n\n·        18 (15 if _Coopertition_ Bonus) AMP & SPEAKER NOTES\\* for Regional & District level events or\n\n·        21 (18 if _Coopertition_ Bonus) AMP & SPEAKER NOTES for District Championship events, or\n\n·        25 (21 if _Coopertition_ Bonus) AMP & SPEAKER NOTES for the _FIRST_ Championship\n\n1\n\n**ENSEMBLE**\n\nAt least 10 STAGE points and at least 2 ONSTAGE ROBOTS\\*\n\n1\n\n**Tie**\n\ncompleting a MATCH with the same number of MATCH points as your opponent\n\n1\n\n**Win**\n\ncompleting a MATCH with more MATCH points than your opponent\n\n2\n\n\\*For District Championship and/or _FIRST_ Championship events, the MELODY and ENSEMBLE requirements may increase.",

A team is issued a RED CARD for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent MATCHES, except as noted below.\n\nOnce a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, its team number is presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning of all subsequent MATCHES, including any replays, as a reminder to the team, the REFEREES, and the audience that they carry a YELLOW CARD.\n\nFigure 6‑4 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD indicators\n\n![P737#yIS1](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image036.jpg)\n\nAll YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of Practice, Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. Verbal warnings are cleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from Qualification MATCHES through subsequent tournament phases. The Head REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a verbal warning or YELLOW CARD earned during Practice MATCHES through to Qualification MATCHES for particularly egregious behavior.\n\n### 6.6.2      YELLOW and RED CARD application\n\nYELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following:\n\nTable 6‑4 YELLOW and RED CARD application\n\n**Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:**\n\n**MATCH to which CARD is applied:**\n\n**prior to Practice MATCHES**\n\nteams first Practice MATCH\n\n**during the Practice MATCHES**\n\nteams current (or just-completed) MATCH.\n\n**between the end of PRACTICE MATCHES and the start of Qualification MATCHES**\n\nteams first Qualification MATCH\n\n**during the Qualification MATCHES**\n\nteams current (or just-completed) MATCH. In the case where the team participated as a SURROGATE in the current (or just completed) MATCH, the card is applied to the teams previous MATCH (i.e. the teams second Qualification MATCH)\n\n**between the end of Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES**\n\nALLIANCES first Playoff MATCH\n\n**during the Playoff MATCHES**\n\nALLIANCES current (or just-completed) MATCH\n\nPlease see examples of the application of YELLOW and RED CARDS as shown in [Section 6.6.4 Violation Details](#_Violation_Details).\n\n### 6.6.3      YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES\n\nDuring Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the violating teams entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If an ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES receive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically, is DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH.\n\n### 6.6.4      Violation Details\n\nThere are several styles of violation wording used in this manual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the violation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible violations, but rather a representative set of combinations.\n\nTable 6‑5 Violation examples\n\n**Example Violation**\n\n**Expanded Interpretation**\n\n**FOUL**\n\nUpon violation, a FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE.\n\n**TECH FOUL and YELLOW CARD**\n\nUpon violation, a TECH FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team with a YELLOW CARD.\n\n**FOUL per additional NOTE. If egregious, YELLOW CARD**\n\nUpon violation, a number of FOULS are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of additional NOTES beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine that the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents the violating team with a YELLOW CARD after the MATCH.\n\n**FOUL, PLUS TECH FOUL IF REPEATED**\n\nUpon initial violation in a MATCH, a FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction in the MATCH, a FOUL and a TECH FOUL are assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in that MATCH, the ROBOT has earned 2 FOULS and a TECH FOUL for their ALLIANCE.\n\n**TECH FOUL, and for every 5 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a TECH FOUL is assessed**\n\nUpon violation, a TECH FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to count. Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met, and for each 5 seconds within that time, an additional TECH FOUL is assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this type of rule for 15 seconds receives a total of 4 TECH FOULS (assuming no other rules were being simultaneously violated).\n\n**RED CARD for the ALLIANCE**\n\nAfter the MATCH, the Head REFEREE presents the violating ALLIANCE with a RED CARD in the following fashion:\n\nIn a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.\n\nIn all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD.",

Additionally, the DRIVE\nTEAM members must be in their starting positions.\n\nIn general, good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH\nready are entirely for the purposes of transitioning the ROBOT into a MATCH\nready state (i.e. not attempts to significantly alter a ROBOTs capabilities.)\nExamples of good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH ready include but are\nnot limited to:\n\nA.     walking safely towards the FIELD with a ROBOT that a team\nis not actively modifying,\n\nB.     applying quick fixes such as tape or cable ties to make the\nROBOT compliant with STARTING CONFIGURATION requirements,\n\nC.     waiting for an OPERATOR CONSOLE computer to boot, and \n\nD.     working with FIELD STAFF to get the ROBOT connected to the\nFIELD.\n\nExamples that are not considered good faith efforts to\nquickly become MATCH ready include but are not limited to:\n\nE.     a ROBOT not moving to the FIELD, \n\nF.     a ROBOT moving to the FIELD but being actively modified\nwhile doing so, \n\nG.     a DRIVE TEAM member remaining on the FIELD once a MATCH is\nready to begin (indicated by the green LEDs having turned off), \n\nH.    installing BUMPERS, charging pneumatic systems, or any\nother ROBOT maintenance not considered a quick fix as described in item B above\nonce on the FIELD, \n\nI.       time-consuming use of alignment devices that are external\nto the ROBOT (e.g. a DRIVE TEAM could bring and use a measuring tape, as long\nas there is no delay to the MATCH by doing so), and\n\nJ.     repairs more substantial than those described in B. \n\nThere are no rules that prohibit use of hand tools\n(including battery operated tools) while setting up ROBOTS from the FIELD,\nprovided they do not cause significant delay or cause safety concerns.\n\n",

					"text": "\n\nTeams should be ready to show INSPECTORS documentation of\nFMV for any COMPONENTS that appear to be in the range of the $600 USD limit.\n\nThe Analog Devices IMU MXP Breakout Board, P/N ADIS16448,\ndoes not have a published FMV. This device is considered to comply with this\nrule regardless of its true FMV.\n\nThe FMV of a COTS item is its price defined by a VENDOR for\nthe part or an identical functional replacement. This price must be generally\navailable to all FIRST Robotics Competition teams throughout the build\nand competition season (i.e. short-term sale prices or coupons do not reflect\nFMV), however teams are only expected to make a good faith effort at\ndetermining the item price and are not expected to monitor prices of ROBOT\nitems throughout the season. The FMV is the cost of the item itself and does\nnot include any duties, taxes, tariffs, shipping, or other costs that may vary\nby locality.\n\nThe FMV of COTS software is the price, set by the VENDOR,\nto license the software (or piece of the software) that runs on the ROBOT for\nthe period from Kickoff to the end of the FIRST Championship. The FMV of\nsoftware licensed free-of-cost, including through the Virtual KOP, for use on\nthe ROBOT is $0.\n\nThe FMV of FABRICATED parts is the value of the material\nand/or labor, except for labor provided by team members (including sponsor\nemployees who are members of the team), members of other teams, and/or event\nprovided machine shops. Material costs are accounted for as the cost of any\npurchasable quantity that can be used to make the individual part (i.e. the\npurchasable raw material is larger than the FABRICATED part).\n\nExample 1: A team orders a custom bracket made by a company\nto the team's specification. The companys material cost and normally charged\nlabor rate apply.\n\nExample 2: A team receives a donated sensor. The company\nwould normally sell this item for $450 USD, which is therefore its FMV.\n\nExample 3: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400\nUSD and has it machined by a local machine shop. The machine shop is not\nconsidered a team sponsor but donates 2 hours of expended labor anyway. The\nteam must include the estimated normal cost of the labor as if it were paid to\nthe machine shop and add it to the $400 USD.\n\nExample 4: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400\nUSD and has it machined by a local machine shop that is a recognized sponsor of\nthe team. If the machinists are considered members of the team, their labor\ncosts do not apply. The total applicable cost for the part would be $400 USD.\n\nIt is in the best interests of the teams and FIRST\nto form relationships with as many organizations as possible. Recognizing\nsupporting companies as sponsors of, and members in, the team is encouraged,\neven if the involvement of the sponsor is solely through the donation of\nfabrication labor.\n\nExample 5: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400\nUSD and has it machined by another team. The total applicable cost for the part\nwould be $400 USD.\n\nExample 6: A team purchases a widget at a garage sale or\nonline auction for $300, but its available for sale from a VENDOR for $700.\nThe FMV is $700.\n\nIf a COTS item is part of a modular system that can be\nassembled in several possible configurations, then each individual module must\nfit within the price constraints defined in this rule. \n\nIf the modules are designed to assemble into a single\nconfiguration, and the assembly is functional in only that configuration, then\nthe total cost of the complete assembly including all modules must fit within\nthe price constraints defined in this rule.\n\nIn summary, if a VENDOR sells a system or a kit, a team\nmust use the entire system/kit FMV and not the value of its COMPONENT pieces.\n\nExample 7: VENDOR A sells a gearbox that can be used with a\nnumber of different gear sets, and can mate with 2 different motors they sell.\nA team purchases the gearbox, a gear set, and a motor, then assembles them\ntogether. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining FMV\nsince the purchased pieces can each be used in various configurations.\n\nExample 8: VENDOR B sells a robotic arm assembly that a\nteam wants to use. However, it costs $630 USD, so they cannot use it. The\nVENDOR sells the hand, wrist, and arm as separate assemblies, for $210\nUSD each. A team wishes to purchase the 3 items separately, then reassemble\nthem. This would not be legal, as they are really buying and using the entire\nassembly, which has a Fair Market Value of $630 USD.\n\nExample 9: VENDOR C sells a set of wheels or wheel modules\nthat are often used in groups of 4. The wheels or modules can be used in other\nquantities or configurations. A team purchases 4 and uses them in the most\ncommon configuration. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of\ndetermining FMV, since the purchased pieces can be used in various\nconfigurations.\n\n",

Per [R409](https://frctools.com/2024/R409) cushion material may extend beyond the end of the plywood in order to fill a corner (see Figure 8‑7).

Drawing large amounts of\ncurrent from many motors at the same time could lead to drops in ROBOT battery\nvoltage that may result in tripping the main breaker or trigger the brownout\nprotection of the roboRIO.

Teams receive 1 hard copy and it is also available at the [_FIRST_ Robotics Competition Event Results site](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/), except during exceptional circumstances. Each Qualification schedule consists of a series of rounds in which each team plays 1 MATCH per round.\n\n### 10.5.2   MATCH Assignment\n\nFMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each Qualification MATCH using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch Qualification MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria, listed in order of priority:\n\n**1.**     ensure each team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by event size)\n\n**2.**     minimize the number of times a team is allied with any team\n\n**3.**     minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team\n\n**4.**     minimize the use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to play an extra Qualification MATCH)\n\n**5.**     provide even distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE\n\n**6.**     provide even distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number\n\nFor more information about the MATCH scheduling algorithm, please see [Idle Loop softwares website](https://idleloop.com/matchmaker/).\n\nAt events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the criteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of times a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even distribution.\n\nAll teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES, equal to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number of MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some teams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those teams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH as a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the MATCH schedule, it is always their third Qualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the teams ranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward to subsequent MATCHES.\n\n### 10.5.3   Qualification Ranking\n\nRanking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCES performance in Qualification MATCHES.

			"markdownContent": "11.1  District Events\n---------------------\n\nDistrict teams are ranked throughout the season based on the points they earn at their first 2 home District events they attend, as well as at their District Championship. Points are awarded to teams as follows:\n\nTable 11‑1 District Point Assignment\n\n**Category**\n\n**Points**\n\n**Qualification Round Performance**\n\n![](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image062.png)\n\n![](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image063.png)\n\n(For a typically sized District event, this will result in a minimum of 4 points being awarded for Qualification round performance.

See [Section 11.1.3 Playoff Performance](#_Playoff_Performance) for details.\n\n**Judged Team Awards**\n\n10 points for _FIRST_ Impact Award (formerly the Chairmans Award)\n\n8 points each for Engineering Inspiration and Rookie All Star Awards\n\n5 points each for all other judged team awards\n\n**Team Age**\n\n10 points for 2024 rookie teams\n\n5 points for 2023 rookie teams\n\nPoints earned at District Championships are multiplied by 3 and then added to points earned at District events, to determine the final season point total for the team.\n\nIf there is a tie in the season point total between teams, those items are broken using the following sorting criteria:\n\nTable 11‑2 District team sort criteria\n\n**Order Sort**\n\n**Criteria**\n\n**1st**\n\nTotal Playoff Performance Points\n\n**2nd**\n\nBest Playoff Round Finish at a single event\n\n**3rd**\n\nTotal ALLIANCE Selection Results Points\n\n**4th**\n\nHighest Qualification Round Seed or Draft Order Acceptance (i.e. Highest ALLIANCE Selection points at a single event)\n\n**5th**\n\nTotal Qualification Round Performance Points\n\n**6th**\n\nHighest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH\n\n**7th**\n\nSecond highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH\n\n**8th**\n\nThird highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH\n\n**9th**\n\nRandom Selection\n\n### 11.1.1   Qualification Round Performance\n\nThe calculation of Qualification performance points is done using the equation (an inverse error function) in Table 11‑1. The equation utilizes the following variables:\n\no   R  the qualification rank of the team at the event at the conclusion of Qualification MATCHES (as reported by FMS)\n\no   N  the number of _FIRST_ Robotics Competition teams participating in the Qualification rounds at the event\n\no   Alpha (α)  a static value (1.07) used to standardize the distribution of points at events\n\nThis formula generates an approximately normal distribution of Qualification Round Performance points at an event, based on rank, with most teams getting a moderate number of points, and fewer teams getting the highest or lowest numbers of points available.\n\nTable 11‑3 displays sample Qualification Round Performance points for variously ranked teams at a 40-team event. The system will automatically generate the appropriate points for each team based on their rank and the number of teams at the event.\n\nTable 11‑3 Sample Qualification Round point assignments\n\n**Rank**\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n**Points**\n\n22\n\n21\n\n20\n\n19\n\n\n\n13\n\n13\n\n12\n\n\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n### 11.1.2   ALLIANCE Selection Results\n\nThis attribute measures both individual team qualification round seeding performance and recognition by peers.\n\nALLIANCE CAPTAINS are recognized based on their qualification round seeding rank. This rank is a result of the rules of the game, which typically incorporate several team performance attributes, and are designed to eliminate ties in rank. Non-ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are rewarded based on peer recognition. To be invited to join an ALLIANCE, a teams peers have decided that the team has attributes that are desirable. Giving points for ALLIANCE selection also supports come-from-behind teams. A team taking several MATCHES to optimize their performance may be recognized as a late bloomer by a top seeded team, even if that performance isnt reflected in the rankings because of poor performance in early MATCHES. These points also have the potential to recognize teams employing a minority strategy with their ROBOT. Teams with unique or divergent ROBOT capabilities that complement the strengths of other ALLIANCE members may be selected to fill a strategic niche.\n\nNote also that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are given the same number of points as the team drafted in the same sequence. For example, the third ALLIANCE CAPTAIN gets the same number of points as the third draft. Numerical analysis supports the idea that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are about as strong in ROBOT performance as equivalently drafted teams. As an additional minor benefit, awarding the same points for ALLIANCE CAPTAINS and equivalent drafts lubricates the acceptance of draft offers between ALLIANCE CAPTAINS, which gives teams out of the top 8 the chance to experience being ALLIANCE CAPTAINS themselves.\n\n### 11.1.3   Playoff Performance\n\nThis attribute measures team performance as part of an ALLIANCE.\n\nTeams that advance to at least MATCH 12 earn Double Elimination (DE) Points per the formula below, where β is defined in Table 11‑4.\n\n![](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/HTML/2024GameManual_files/image064.png)\n\nTable 11‑4 Double Elimination Points, β values\n\n**ALLIANCE Finish**\n\n**β**\n\n**1st Place (Winners)**\n\n20\n\n**2nd Place (Finalists)**\n\n20\n\n**3rd Place (loser of MATCH 13)**\n\n13\n\n**4th Place (loser of MATCH 12)**\n\n7\n\nIn most cases, unless a BACKUP is recruited, a team plays 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, thus their DE Points simply equal β. If a team does not play 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, their DE Points equal their β value multiplied by the percentage of DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE in which that team participated. If the result is not a whole number, the value is rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\nTeams on the winning ALLIANCE are awarded additional Finals Points, which are 5 points for each Finals MATCH won and in which the team participated, up to a maximum of 10 points.\n\nFor example, if Team Xs ALLIANCE wins the event, but Team X only played in 2 MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, MATCH 13 and Final 1, Team Xs Playoff Performance points are 20 \\* (1/5) + 5 = 9 points.\n\nThe maximum number of Playoff Performance Points a team can earn is 30 (20 DE points + 10 Finals Points).\n\n### 11.1.4   Awards\n\nThis attribute measures team performance with respect to team awards judged at the event.\n\nThe points earned for team awards in this system are not intended to capture the full value of the award to the team winning the award, or to represent the full value of the award to _FIRST_. In many ways, the teams experience in being selected for awards, especially the _FIRST_ Impact Award, the Engineering Inspiration Award, and the Rookie All Star Award (which is optional for District Championship events), is beyond measure, and could not be fully captured in its entirety by any points-based system. Points are being assigned to awards in this system only to help teams recognize that _FIRST_ continues to be _More than Robots®_, with the emphasis on our cultural awards, and to assist in elevating award-winning teams above non-award-winning teams in the ranking system.\n\nTeams only get points for team awards judged at the event. If an award is not judged (e.g. Rookie Highest Seed), is not for a team (e.g. the Deans List Award) or is not judged at the event (e.g. Safety Animation Award, sponsored by UL), no points are earned.\n\n### 11.1.5   Team Age\n\nThis attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively new team.\n\nPoints are awarded to 2023 and 2024 rookie teams in recognition of the unique challenges teams face in those early years, and to increase the chance that they will make it to the District Championship to compete with their ROBOTS. Like our dedicated Rookie awards, these additional points are intended to recognize and motivate newer participants in _FIRST_ Robotics Competition. These points are awarded once at the beginning of the season. Rookie year is calculated based on the year in which _FIRST_ recognizes the team as a rookie.\n\n### 11.1.6   Regional Participation\n\nDistrict teams neither earn points for their actions at any Regionals, nor are eligible for any _FIRST_ Championship qualifying benefits at that Regional (awards, Wild Cards, etc.). If a District team is on the winning ALLIANCE, a Wild Card is awarded to the next qualifying team. If they are on the finalist ALLIANCE and would be awarded a Wild Card, they are skipped.",
